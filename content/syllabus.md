## Policies

### Academic Integrity

Absolute integrity is expected of all Cornell students in every academic undertaking. The course staff will prosecute violations aggressively using automatic detection tools.

You are responsible for understanding these policies:

- <a href="http://cuinfo.cornell.edu/Academic/AIC.html">Cornell University Code of Academic Integrity</a>
- <a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/ugrad/CSMajor/index.htm#ai">Computer Science Department Code of Academic Integrity</a>

You can also read about the [protocol for prosecution of violations][aiproceedings].

[aiproceedings]: http://www.theuniversityfaculty.cornell.edu/AcadInteg/index.html

On **assignments**, everything you turn in must be 100% completely your own work (with your partner, if you have one). You may discuss with other students about requirements for the assignment, programming in OCaml, etc. But when it comes to developing specific answers or coding, you may not talk to other students except for your partner or anyone else. Specifically:

* Do not show any partial solution to another student or give any hints.
* Never share code. (Shared code is surprisingly easy to detect.)
* Do not search the Internet for solutions. Don't look anything relevant up on Wikipedia. Don't search on Stack Overflow or anywhere else.
* *Do* ask someone if you're confused about what the assignment is asking for.
* *Definitely* ask the course staff if you're not sure whether or not something is OK.

Here's the policy for **exams**: outside of the course staff, you may not talk to anyone about any exam content at all until the exam is graded.
Don't even tell anyone how you're feeling about the exam or what you found challenging: you must pretend that you have never seen the exam.
You can use notes from the class, including both your own notes and our notes from the website, but not outside resources.

You may not give any hints or post any code that might be part of a solution on Slack (except in a private message with course staff).
On both assignments and exams, the web is always off limits: you may not Google anything or look anything up on Wikipedia to get help, for example.

### Respect in Class

Everyone—the instructor, TAs, and students—must be respectful of everyone else in this class. All communication, in class and online, will be held to a high standard for inclusiveness: it may never target individuals or groups for harassment, and it may not exclude specific groups. That includes everything from outright animosity to the subtle ways we phrase things and even our timing.

For example: do not talk over other people; don't use male pronouns when you mean to refer to people of all genders; avoid explicit language that has a chance of seeming inappropriate to other people; and don't let strong emotions get in the way of calm, scientific communication.

If any of the communication in this class doesn't meet these standards, please don't escalate it by responding in kind. Instead, contact the instructor as early as possible. If you don't feel comfortable discussing something directly with the instructor—for example, if the instructor is the problem—please contact the advising office or the department chair.

### Special Needs and Wellness

We provide accommodations for disabilities.
Students with disabilities can contact <a href="http://sds.cornell.edu">Student Disability Services</a> at
607-254-4545 or the instructor for a confidential discussion of their
individual needs.

If you experience personal or academic stress or need to talk to someone who can help, contact the instructor or:
