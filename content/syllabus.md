## Policies

### Academic Integrity

Absolute integrity is expected of all Cornell students in every academic undertaking. The course staff will prosecute violations aggressively.

You are responsible for understanding these policies:

- <a href="http://cuinfo.cornell.edu/Academic/AIC.html">Cornell University Code of Academic Integrity</a>
- <a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/ugrad/CSMajor/index.htm#ai">Computer Science Department Code of Academic Integrity</a>

You can also read about the [protocol for prosecution of violations][aiproceedings].

[aiproceedings]: http://www.theuniversityfaculty.cornell.edu/AcadInteg/index.html

Everything you turn in must be ether 100% completely your own work or clearly attributed to someone else.
You may discuss your work with other students, look for help online, get writing feedback from the instructor, ask your friend to help debug something, or anything else that doesn't involve someone else doing your work for you.
You may not turn in any writing that you did not do yourself or misrepresent existing implementation work as your own.

The projects in this course are open source, and you may use existing code in your implementation—including code written by other students in this course. You must, however, make it clear which code is yours and which code is borrowed from where.

### Respect in Class

Everyone—the instructor, TAs, and students—must be respectful of everyone else in this class. All communication, in class and online, will be held to a high standard for inclusiveness: it may never target individuals or groups for harassment, and it may not exclude specific groups. That includes everything from outright animosity to the subtle ways we phrase things and even our timing.

For example: do not talk over other people; don't use male pronouns when you mean to refer to people of all genders; avoid explicit language that has a chance of seeming inappropriate to other people; and don't let strong emotions get in the way of calm, scientific communication.

If any of the communication in this class doesn't meet these standards, please don't escalate it by responding in kind. Instead, contact the instructor as early as possible. If you don't feel comfortable discussing something directly with the instructor—for example, if the instructor is the problem—please contact the advising office or the department chair.

### Special Needs and Wellness

We provide accommodations for disabilities.
Students with disabilities can contact <a href="http://sds.cornell.edu">Student Disability Services</a> at
607-254-4545 or the instructor for a confidential discussion of their
individual needs.

If you experience personal or academic stress or need to talk to someone who can help, contact the instructor or:
