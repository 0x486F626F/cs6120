# Project 3: Write an LLVM Pass

- Proposal due: October 30, 2019
- Report due: November 13, 2019


## Overview

The point of Project 3 is to learn to use the [LLVM][] compiler infrastructure.
The scope is similar to [Project 1][p1], i.e., small: you don't need to make anything too ambitious; just build something that works and evaluate it rigorously.

The end result of your project should be an LLVM [pass][llvm pass]â€”a thing that reads or transforms LLVM IR programs.
Unless you have a very good reason not to, you will implement your pass in C++ so you have access to the full power of the LLVM API.
Unlike in Project 1, your pass needs to work on full-scale, real-world programs rather than just on small tests.
