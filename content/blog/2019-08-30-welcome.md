I'm incredibly excited to teach CS 6120, a new PhD-level course about compilers at Cornell!
We're using a broad definition of "compilers" that covers all aspects of language implementation.

We'll use this course blog for [paper discussion][discussion] and [project reports][project] throughout the semester.

[discussion]: @/discussion.md
[project]: @/project/_index.md
