## Overview

## Evaluation

### Feature Wish list:
- criticality testing
- rates for nested loops: possibly exponential rates moving inward
- accelerated loop perforation
- storing previous values instead of skipping
- Outrageous baselines that work as well, e.g. skipping random instructions
- the loss of accuracy may introduce bias in, e.g., ML
- parsec
- accuracy measure
- should we bother with their greedy exploration?
