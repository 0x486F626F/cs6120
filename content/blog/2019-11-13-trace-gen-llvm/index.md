Let's generate traces from llvm!
---------------------------

## Overview

In this project we use llvm to generate traces and execute them. We use llvm passes to log all the traces in a program and use another pass to create an executable that only executes a selected trace. This could be useful to implement efficient trace selection, or to implement trace-based llvm passes in general.
