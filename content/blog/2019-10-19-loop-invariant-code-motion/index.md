Loop Invariant Code Motion hoists what doesn't need to be in the loop (invariant code) out of the loop. This optimization cuts down the number of instructions executed, by ensuring unnecessary repetition is avoided. Our implementation first identifies movable components, then iteratively moves them. 

Skip to the end to optimize your very own `bril` program!

# Loop

All loops considered here are **natural loops**â€”that is, a cycle with one entry and a **back-edge**. Back-edges are defined as an edge $A \longrightarrow B$ for tail $A$ and head $B$, such that $B$ dominates $A$.  Natural loops are then defined as the smallest set of vertices $L$ with $A,B \el L$ such that for each vertex $v \el L$ we have $v=B$ or PREDS($v$)$\subseteq L$.

In essence, a back-edge is what brings us from the end $A$ of the loop back to the beginning $B$. If the loop has more than one entry, it is not a natural loop. Below is an illustration of a natural loop and its back-edge. 

### Detection

To find the loop invariant code, first we must detect all natural loops. To accomplish this, we make use of control flow graphs from `cfg.py` and dominator trees from `dom.py` within our three functions. Back-edges are identified with `get_backedges` which takes in a map of successors and the dominator tree. `loopsy` finds the natural loop associated with an input back-edge. Every natural loop associated with a back-edge is then identified this way within `natloops` which is the main function. 

```python
from cfg import *
from dom import *
from df import *

def get_backedges(successors,domtree):
    backedges = set()
    for source,sinks in successors.items():
        for sink in sinks:
            if sink in domtree[source]:
                backedges.add((source,sink))

    return backedges

def loopsy(source,sink,predecessors):
    worklist = [source]
    loop = set()
    while len(worklist)>0:
        current = worklist.pop()
        pr = predecessors[current]
        for p in pr:
            if not(p in loop or p==sink):
                loop.add(p)
                worklist.append(p)
    loop.add(sink)
    loop.add(source)
   
    return loop

def natloops(blocks): #input backedge
    pred,succ = edges(blocks)
    dom = get_dom(succ,list(blocks.keys())[0])
    for source,sink in get_backedges(succ,dom):
        yield loopsy(source,sink,pred) # natloops

```

### Invariance
Code may be marked as loop invariant if

# Motion


Now we know how to spot what can move, let's move it!
